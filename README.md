GitHub Stats Dashboard

Architecture
The MVP architecture of the GitHub Stats Dashboard project will consist of a web client that communicates with a web server. The web client will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and will use Plotly to generate visualizations. The web server will be built using Python and Flask, and will use the GitHub API to retrieve data about the user's GitHub activity. The data will be stored in a PostgreSQL database.

APIs and Methods
The following API routes will be created for the web client to communicate with the web server:
- `/api/repos`: Retrieves data about the user's repositories.
- `/api/commits`: Retrieves data about the user's commits.
- `/api/pulls`: Retrieves data about the user's pull requests.
- `/api/issues`: Retrieves data about the user's issues.

The following API endpoints will be created to allow other clients to use:
- `/api/user/<username>`: Retrieves data about a specific user.

The project will use the GitHub API to retrieve data about the user's GitHub activity.

Data Model
The data model for the GitHub Stats Dashboard project will consist of three tables: `users`, `repositories`, and `commits`. The `users` table will store information about the user, such as their GitHub username and access token. The `repositories` table will store information about the user's repositories, such as the repository name and number of stars. The `commits` table will store information about the user's commits, such as the commit message and timestamp.

User Stories
1. As a user, I want to be able to see a breakdown of my coding activity by programming language, so that I can identify which languages I am most proficient in and which ones I need to improve.
2. As a developer, I want to be able to view a dashboard that provides an overview of my coding activity, including the number of repositories, commits, pull requests, and issues.
3. As a user, I want to be able to compare my coding activity to that of other developers in my organization or industry, so that I can see how I stack up and identify areas for improvement.
4. As a developer, I want to be able to view the coding activity of job candidates, so that I can assess their skills and experience.
5. As a user, I want to be able to view detailed information about my pull requests, including the number of open and closed pull requests, the average time to merge, and the number of comments.

Mockups
