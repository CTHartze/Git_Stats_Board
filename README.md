# GitHub Stats Dashboard

As a software engineering student, my goal was to create a project that would allow me to explore different technologies and frameworks while also providing a useful tool for developers. So I decided to build a GitHub user statistics dashboard that would allow users to enter multiple GitHub usernames and display their statistics in a single view.
